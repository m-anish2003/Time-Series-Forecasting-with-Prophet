![Prophet Logo](https://imgs.search.brave.com/9hZ3NDgua4CYguV-1CycfzZiehEW0MkDIM9frK026a0/rs:fit:500:0:0:0/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cu/ZGF0YWJyaWNrcy5j/b20vd3AtY29udGVu/dC91cGxvYWRzLzIw/MjAvMDEvRkItUHJv/cGhldC1sb2dvLnBu/Zw)

## Overview
This repository demonstrates how to perform time series forecasting using [Facebook's Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/), a powerful open-source library designed for forecasting time series data that exhibits seasonality and trends. The project includes a step-by-step guide, example datasets, and visualizations to help you understand Prophet’s capabilities.

---

## Features
- Introduction to Facebook’s Prophet library.
- Step-by-step demonstration of forecasting with Prophet.
- Real-world dataset for practical implementation.
- Insights into seasonality, trend decomposition, and forecast visualization.
- Simple and reproducible Python code for quick experimentation.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the environment and get started:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Time-Series-Forecasting-with-Prophet.git
   cd Time-Series-Forecasting-with-Prophet
   ```

2. Install required dependencies using `pip` or `conda`:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib prophet
   ```

   If you are using `conda`, use:
   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge prophet
   ```

   For additional installation help, refer to the [Prophet installation guide](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/installation.html).

## Usage
1. **Load the Notebook**
   Open the Jupyter Notebook `00_Intro_to_Facebook_Prophet.ipynb` to explore the guided implementation.

2. **Prepare Your Dataset**
   Ensure your dataset is in a CSV file with the following format:
   - `ds`: Date column in `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format.
   - `y`: Numeric column representing the target variable to forecast.

3. **Run the Code**
   Execute the notebook to:
   - Load and preprocess data.
   - Fit the Prophet model.
   - Visualize the forecast and its components.

---

## Example Dataset
The project uses the `BeerWineLiquor.csv` dataset as an example. You can replace it with your own dataset following the same structure.

---

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Forecasting trends and seasonality with Prophet.
- Visualization of future predictions.
- Adjusting Prophet parameters for custom time series behavior.
